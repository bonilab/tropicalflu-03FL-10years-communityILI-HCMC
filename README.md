# A combination of annual and nonannual forces drive respiratory disease in the tropics

We detected the annual and nonannual periodic signals in respiratory diseases and influenza based on a community-based surveillance system in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. We also showed these periodic signals would substantially improve the model performance in predicting the pattern of respiratory diseases and influenza.  

## Needed plug-ins 
`datasets` stores all the original csv files needed to reproduce the results.
`functions` stores all the needed functions.
`Rdata` will save all the Rdata generated from the scripts. The multiple-step function results that are generated from Roar Supercomputer in Pennsylvania State University are provided in `Results from Roar`. The ILI from other regions are provided in `Global ILI`.

## Reproduce the results of respiratory diseases (influenza-like-illness,ILI)
Run the scripts under `ILI` in order.

## Reproduce the results of influenza (ILI+)
Run the scripts under `ILI+` in order.
